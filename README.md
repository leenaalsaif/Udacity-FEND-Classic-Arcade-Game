# Udacity's Classic Arcade Game

## Game Description
In order to graduate from Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree program, Udacity asked us to implement what we have learned about Object-Oriented Programming into a 2D game run on HTML's canvas. The game is about a boy, trying to cross the street to get to the river. And in order to cross safely, he has to avoid all the bugs or he has to start the game all over again.
